This creates a growing market for PPE products that adhere to stringent safety standards, particularly in high-risk sectors like forestry. As companies focus more on compliance, there will be opportunities for manufacturers and distributors of high-quality, regulation-compliant PPE to expand their market share. <p>Another opportunity lies in the expanding trend of sustainable and eco-friendly PPE. As environmental awareness grows, workers and businesses in the forestry and gardening sectors are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of their activities.
